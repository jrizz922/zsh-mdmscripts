Using this repostory to store dotfile, shell, and environment manipulating scripts.

Note: In one of these scripts we reference a hardened version of a .zshrc file. The example we use is from drduh, and can be found at [https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/zshrc](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/zshrc)
